# Megatype + Foundation
Proof-of-concept integration of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) with [MegaType](https://github.com/StudioThick/megatype). 
This build represents a starting point example for building Foundation and MegaType together; Not all Foundation components have received attention to fix their baseline snapping; developers should apply as needed to relevant components. 
    
## Development setup  
Install Node modules:  
`npm install`  
    
Install Front End Bower components:  
`bower install`  
    
Main development task; watch for changes:  
`gulp develop`   
    
To build and minify files for production:  
`gulp build`  
 
NOTE: This is a proof of concept for build only, and is unlikely to receive ongoing support from the MegaType team.
